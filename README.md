# Overview
This is an alternative RF System for hobbists which has flexibility in mind. It mainly consists of a remote controller and a receiver, both powered by the STM32F103 (Blue Pill). Thanks to this hardware yo can easily get 15 PWM channels to drive traditional stuff like servos and ESCs. Additionally, you can configure GPIO pins as you please
